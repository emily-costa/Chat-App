# Chat App
## [Live Version](https://cs336-hmwk11-chatapp.web.app/)

This project was generated with Angular CLI.

This web application uses Cloud Firestore to store the user's handle, message, color, and timestamp of the user's input. The user's handle and chosen color are also stored in the local storage, and these values persist over multiple sessions until they are changed by the user.
